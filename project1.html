	<p id="brief">brief</p>
	<p id="briefd">For a 3 week class project, my team was tasked with coming up with a design intervention for
		a cultural arts event. From a list of clients provided to us, we<br> chose <span style="font-family:bdLofi">The Flying Dutch</span>. Although our
		intervention was ill-defined, we had to make sure that it would not be COVID-19 related.</p>

		<p id="client">the client</p>
		<p id="clientd">The Flying Dutch is the largest Dutch EDM/House concert that runs simultaneously
			in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven. The 11 hour rave accomodates about<br> 100,000 attendies
			throughout the 3 cities it plays in. The festival flies its performers to the venues, which
			is where the festival gets its name.</p>

			<p id="primary">identifying  the problem  <span style="color:#b2b0b0">primary  research</span></p>
			<p id="primaryd">After scanning through the existing <span style="font-family:bdLofi">The  Flying  Dutch</span>
				website, we found little
		    to no information regarding travelling to the venues in each of the cities.<br> The website mainly
				focuses on showcasing the experience that is the concert. These three cities, already being
				quite congested on a regular basis, attract huge<br> amounts of tourism every year the event occurs.
				With further research, we found this to be a great area to drive our problem space. At the time
				of the last played<br> concert (2018), all three ﻿cities consistently ranked high in traffic congestion
				charts within the Neatherlands.</p>

			<p id="learning">Further learning about the challenges of a tourist in a new city became pivotal primary
				insight. Visitors to a new city require navigational applications<br> to effectively move around.
				However, being unaware of the cities patterns, traffic and transit schedules slow the flow of
				their movement throught the city.</p>

			<img id="blue" src="howcan.svg">

			<p id="secondary">identifying  the problem  <span style="color:#b2b0b0">secondary  research</span></p>
			<p id="secondaryd">We had to make sure that the audience attending the venue fit within the problem space.
				Through 1 on 1 interviews and surveys, we found various key insights. <br>Firstly, the audience of major
				events are aware of the fact that they cause further congestion within the city they are in. Secondly,
				some of the audience choose<br> to drive to the events due to comfort and safety. Similarly, other members
				of the audience avoid driving on big event days and choose to take transit to also<br> avoid other reasons
				such as drinking and driving. Due to the traffic and transit congestion created by the audience of The
				Flying Dutch, both the audience and<br> the DJ’s involved find it difficult to travel through the city to
				their destination the day of the event, which is where our problem space is defined.</p>

				<p id="final">final product</p>
				<p id="finald">Our final product consists in an addition to the already existing website of The Flying
					Dutch. By using the pre-existing cookies of the website, we could create a<br> heat map of everyone whose
					purchased a ticket. This extension is not meant to replace navigational applications such as google
					maps, but influence how you<br> are moving around the city. Both the performers and audience can see what
					areas are most congested thanks to<br> heat map, and influence how they decide to get to the venue with
					the time that they have.</p>
