			<p id="brief">brief</p>
			<p id="briefd">For a 5 week class project, my team was tasked with coming up <br>with a visual design intervention
				for a cultural arts exhibition. The <br>project consisted in making both a poster and a micro-site for our <br>proposed
				client, <span id="boldbig" style="font-family:Replica Bold" style="letter-spacing:-0.05vw;">Fuorisalone.</span></p>

			<p id="client">the client</p>
			<p id="clientd">Fuorisalone is an annual event held in Milan that celebrates and <br>showcases design throughout the
				city. Fuorisalone is defined by <br>its lack of central organizer, allowing anyone to participate and <br>independently
				hold their own event. Each year, this results in <br>hundreds of events, ensuring that there is something to see
				and <br>do at all times.</p>

			<p id="overview"> overview</p>
			<p id="overviewd">With a focus on developing qualities and principles, our first three <br>weeks were dedicated to
					developing our line of explorations. The <br>following weeks were used to familiarize ourselves with the Fuori <br>
					Salone in Milan so that we could successfully translate our final line <br>of exploration to portray the breadth
					of our content.

			<p id="lang"> the visual language</p>
			<p id="langd">The overall visual language of the poster focused on a typographic <br>contrast of both Neue Haas Grotesk
				and Azaret Mono. Neue Haas <br>Grotesk stays legible even when we apply texture and greatly <br>reduce leading and spacing.
				Azeret Mono paired well with the <br>grotesk due to its contrast in both weight and spacing. It’s modern <br>look and feel
				complemented Neue Haas’s classic aesthetic for a <br>contemporary appeal. Koulen was used for its condensed, <br>vertical
				characters preventing type from getting too long while being <br>legibile at any angle.</p>

			<p id="secondary"> secondary assets</p>

			<p id="secondaryd">Our exploration of the poster in assets from the second week <br>inspired us to work backwards,
				tempering our use of colour and <br>space while further highlighting the principle of scale.</p>

			<p id="fromptod">from print to digital</p>

			<p id="fromptodd">The final two weeks of the project were then used to translate our <br>chosen visual direction
				into an interactive microsite for our given <br>client. We developed a content strategy and explored various
				interactions <br>in order to develop a novel and expressive interactive experience.</p>

				<p id="content">content strategy</p>

				<p id="contentd">Fuori  Salone  houses over 900 exhibits annually, our challenge was <br>deciding on how we would
					limit this amount of content. Thus rather <br>than explicitly talking about only the exhibits, our approach focuses
					on the <br>themes that participating districts provide each year. Using tools such as <br>a quiz, and with layouts
					that prioritize describing the background of the <br>districts, we prime the visitors for the event by guiding them
					to craft a <br>personal experience to resonate with the themes. </p>

				<p id="quizz"> quizz entrance</p>

				<p id="quizzd">These districts are not just a grouping of exhibits by proximity, <br>there are underlying themes
					connecting them. The quiz is <br>designed to personalize the user experience to their input while <br>also getting
					them to think about the topics related to each district. <br>To keep the visitor informed on their progress,
					they are provided <br>with consistent feedback through numbers. </p>

			<p id="navan"> navigation animation</p>

			<p id="navand">The navigational element of the website is created based on the <br>order of the topics chosen by the
				visitor. This animation further <br>informs the user that each district is related to a theme, keeping <br>them aware
				of what content to expect if they were to click on the <br>navigational elements. </p>

		<p id="district"> district content</p>

		<p id="districtd">Once the visitor has landed on the district page, we want to <br>establish a different mood from
			each district that gives them a <br>vague idea of the district’s aesthetics and history. We then guide <br>the user
			down the page using pink elements that bleed off the <br>edges to where the content will appear next. By making
			each <br>paragraph appear as they scroll, there is a sense of reward as they <br>move down the page and we establish
			that scrolling is how you <br>progress through the content. </p>

	<p id="exhibit"> the exhibits</p>

	<p id="exhibitd">At the bottom of each district page is a horizontal list of exhibits. <br>This section is meant to give
		the user a break from the constant <br>stream of information and explore the exhibits at their own pace, <br>based on what
		titles intrigue them. By hovering over the title’s, <br>they grow in size indicating that there is an interaction and on
		click, <br>the title opens up to reveal details about each exhibit. </p>

</span>

<p id="next"> next district</p>

<p id="nextd">Once the user is no longer interested in the exhibits, they can move to the following district by<br>
	continuing to scroll past a resistive border between districts. This continues our initial language<br> of scrolling,
	while not allowing users to immediately or accidentally skip past the exhibit list of <br>each page. If the user is
	unable to discover this scroll, they can also simply click on the next <br>district in the top-right navigation.   </p>
