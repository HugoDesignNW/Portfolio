			<p id="brief">brief</p>
			<p id="briefd">For a 6 week class project, my team was tasked with providing an <br>experience design intervention
				for a researched client. After 2 <br>weeks of research, we solidified the need for an intervention <br>for Canada Post.</p>

			<p id="client">the client</p>
			<p id="clientd">In their 2022 financial report, Canada Post revealed that letter <br>delivery has been on the decline
				for the past 17 years. In the <br>parcel delivery space, they’ve been losing market share to faster, <br>cheaper competitors
				such as FedEx or UPS. As a response, the <br>crown corporation seeks to extend its offerings beyond traditional <br>postage
				services.</p>

		<p id="proposal">proposal</p>
		<p id="proposald">Carriers that Care is a service focused on delivering <br>companionship to socially isolated seniors
					through a subscription <br>based check-in, utilizing the existing Canada Post network and <br>infrastructure. Our goal
					is to support Canadian seniors who <br>desire to live independently, update long-distance families, and <br>extend
					the Canada Post services beyond mail delivery. <br>Canada Post’s status as one of the most trusted services for
					<br>Canadians served as a great leverage for our proposed service.</p>

			<p id="opportunity">opportunity</p>
			<p id="opportunityd">After cross referencing successful programs within other <br>countries’ postal services, we found out
				that the Canadian <br>Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), has been advocating for the <br>introduction of this service since 2016.
				<br><br>
        We wanted to take the success of these already stablished programs <br>and test them within the high aging Canadian
				population. </p>

	    <p id="framing">framing</p>

			<p id="user">user research</p>
			<p id="userd">Through a 3 day sprint session, we aimed to get a better <br>understanding of our company’s goals, services and
				challenges <br>dealing with all the stakeholders.
				<br><br>
				Our sprint was comprised of activities such as HMW’s, golden <br>path explorations, and competitor analyses, we found
				ourselves <br>battling with establishing trust from the elder’s families, <br>gaining consent, and building rapport with the
				elders.</p>


			<p id="interview">user interviews</p>
			<p id="interviewd">We soon after did 2-3 user interviews each, to verify that our <br>concerns were in line with our users.
				We had to make sure that <br>we were interviewing people who lived away from their parents, <br>who cared about their
				parents independence.
				<br><br>
				Our main critique dealt with medical ethics and the service <br>feeling impersonal. We also received a common critique
				which <br>said “I feel like my parents would just ask why are you not <br>coming? Why is the mail person coming for you”
				<br><br>
				With these new found concerns, we had to redefine our service value <br>further. We consulted the Canadian National
				Institute of Ageing <br>framework for supporting older adults ageing in their homes. </p>

				<img id="pillars" src="pillars.svg">

				<p id="pillard">As we saw friction with the idea of having a postal worker being in a <br>position of power with the
					elderly, we shifted our focus to improving <br>social connections to reduce loneliness and social isolation. </p>

				<p id="finalP">carrier's that care - final prototype</p>
				<p id="finalPd">To explain our service design proposal, we decided to separate our <br>touchpoints into 3 separatee phases.
					Phase 1, Canada Post product <br>page. Phase 2, Postal Worker App. Phase 3, Text and Email Updates.
					<br><br>
					Carriers that Care begins in the Canada Post website. The homepage <br>provides clear information for seniors and
					families registering loved ones, <br>emphasizing transparency on service logistics, limitations, and expectations.
​					<br><br>

					Once the service is set up, the Mail Carrier App gives the carrier <br>access to resources that may be needed during
					a visit, and the reports <br>necessary to complete the visit.

					Once the visit is done, and the report filed, the families are notified <br>through text or email notifications, both
					leading to the Carriers that <br>Care Dashboard.	</p>

					<p id="subdomain">canada post subdomain</p>
					<p id="subdomaind">The Carriers that Care homepage provides clear information for <br>seniors and families registering
						loved ones, emphasizing transparency <br>on service logistics, limitations, and expectations.

						The onboarding assumes users have a pre-existing Canada Post <br>account. It follows a standard sign-up process,
						collecting recipient <br>information, visitation availability, specific visit questions, optional <br>details about the
						recipient, and payment preferences. Users choose <br>notification preferences (text or email) and are informed that
						service <br>starts after recipient confirmation.	</p>

						<p id="mailapp">mail carrier app</p>
						<p id="mailappd">While on route, the mail carrier will have a list of recipients to visit. <br>They can give a call
							to inform the recipient, they are on their way for a <br>20-30 minute visit. Upon visit, the two would have a conversation
							<br>with the recipient and assist with small tasks. Post-visit, they will be <br>prompted to complete a report the details of
							their visitation, formatted to be <br>short and easy to reduce the cognitive overhead for the busy postal worker.
​						<br><br>
							The mail carrier also has access to resources for managing unforeseen <br>situations and can quickly connect with emergency services
							for urgent issues.	</p>

							<p id="updates">post visit updates</p>
							<p id="updatesd">Subscribers will receive visitation updates via text or email and <br>redirected to the Canada
								Post dashboard for further details. Here, <br>users will be able to update their account information, edit
								visitation <br>details and manage family members on the plan. As well, get to know <br>the mail carrier visiting
								their loved one and be informed of any changes.
​								<br><br>
								Send a Gift, is an extension of Carrier that Care which leverages <br>Canada Post existing service to purchase
								gift through Canada Shop to <br>promote Canadian-owned businesses. The recipients’ family can <br>purchase a gift
								through Canada Post and have it hand-delivered <br>during Carrier that Care visits.	</p>

								<p id="discovery">discovery</p>
								<p id="discoveryd">It was important to us to consider the discovery process, as we <br>wanted to appeal to a mass
									audience, and needed to make sure we <br>were as seen as possible. During our second sprint, I came up with the
									<br>idea of a package sticker, that would be put on every package that <br>was dealt by Canada Post. The primary way
									we expect customers to <br>discover the service is through word of mouth or online advertisements, <br>however these
									stickers offer an opportunity to invite existing <br>customers to learn about the service, while staying true to
									the brand assets.	</p>


								<img id="box" src="box.svg">

								<p id="concerns">addressing user concenrns</p>
								<p id="concernsd">Throughout our user interviews, the most common concern dealt with <br>building personal
									connections with seniors and their safety. To avoid <br>feeling impersonal, we included a section for the
									families signing up <br>their senior relatives to fill, in which they can include their hobbies and <br>interests.
									By doing so, there are opportunities for the carriers to have <br>a personal point of connection with the
									seniors, or just use them as a <br>conversation starter.	</p>

									<img id="concern" src="concern.svg">

									<p id="learn">Part of the discovery experience is learning about the <br>service, the potential safety
										concerns and how the services interact with each <br>other. For this, we created different touchpoints,
										through the website <br>and a pamphlet. Through the subdomain we treated it as a safeguard <br>to make sure
										that the families are discussing the service with their <br>loved ones. This is because consent is the highest
										priority for the <br>service, and we want to make sure that the service does not <br>commence until consent has
										been given. 	</p>

										<img id="pamphlet" src="pamphlet.svg">

										<p id="brand">brand redesign</p>
										<p id="brandd">To address concerns from initial user testing where people were <br>confused about how
											Carriers that Care differentiates from <br>Canada Post’s letter and parcel delivery services, I created
											a <br>dedicated design system for the service, where I focused on the <br>components, color and type.
​										<br><br>
											This new illustration style is used to guide our branding towards a <br>more approachable and familiar
											feeling. These also help us guide <br>our interactions, or if there is a lot of information to digest.	</p>
