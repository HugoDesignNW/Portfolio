	 <p id="introtext"> An experimental visual design project for the Broken Nature exhibition at the Triennale di Milano museum. This exhibition focuses on<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                     “restorative design” approaches that explore the complex relationships with the natural world. The project consists of a poster and an interactive microsite.</p>﻿

	<p id="brief">brief</p>
	<p id="briefd">For a 5 week class project, my team was tasked with coming up with a visual design
		intervention for a cultural arts museum. The project consisted in making<br> both a poster and a
		micro-site for our proposed client,<span style="font-family:bdLofi">La Triennale di Milano</span>.</p>

		<p id="client">the client</p>
		<p id="clientd"><span style="font-family:bdLofi">La Triennale di Milano</span> is a museum for art and design located in the Palazzo dell’Arte in
			Milan, Italy. It is host to the Milan Triennial every 3 years. <br>The aim of the institution is to be
			“the engine of an important international dialogue between design, the arts and society.”</p>

			<p id="overview">overview</p>
			<p id="overviewd">This project allowed us to freely discover experimental design methods that
				pushed us to express emotion. Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop was used to find<br> effects that would
				be in line with our stablished design principles. The key was to find the middle ground between
				experimentation and good design. Since the<br> exhibition highlights the interaction between nature
				and design, the intent of the work is to subtly emphasize our relationship with technology.</p>

			<p id="mood">moodboard</p>
			<p id="moodd">The approach centers around <span style="font-family:Neue Hass Grotesc">futuristic</span> and <span style="font-family:Neue Hass Grotesc">organic</span> elements which provoke a
				feeling of <span style="font-family:Neue Hass Grotesc">frigid</span> cleanliness. Drawing inspiration from organic design<br> approaches and forms,
				sterile nature, liminal spaces and the constant fight of technology vs nature.
				<br>
				<br>
				Architectural and spatial elements which have an overall <span style="font-family:Neue Hass Grotesc">clean and cold tone, composed of white and blue colour palettes.</span> Ultimately, spaces which are <br>devoid of human interaction or natural elements.

				<p id="visuald">Throughout the experimentation process, we learned multiple techniques that stablished our visual language and drove the project. Printing and scanning <br>and colour and type ﻿experimentation drove our process.</p>
