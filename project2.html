	<p id="brief">brief</p>
	<p id="briefd">For a 5 week class project, my team was tasked with coming up <br>with a visual design
		intervention for a cultural arts museum. The <br>project consisted in making both a poster and a
		micro-site for our <br>proposed client,La Triennale di Milano.</p>

		<p id="client">the client</p>
		<p id="clientd">La Triennale di Milano is a museum for art and design located in <br>the Palazzo dell’Arte in
			Milan, Italy. It is host to the Milan Triennial<br> every 3 years. The aim of the institution is to be
			'the engine of an <br>important international dialogue between design, the arts and society.'</p>

			<p id="overview">overview</p>
			<p id="overviewd">This project allowed us to freely discover experimental design<br> methods that
				pushed us to express emotion. Adobe Illustrator and<br> Photoshop was used to find effects that would
				be in line with our<br> stablished design principles. The key was to find the middle ground<br> between
				experimentation and good design. Since the exhibition<br> highlights the interaction between nature
				and design, the intent of<br> the work is to subtly emphasize our relationship with technology.</p>

			<p id="mood">moodboard</p>
			<p id="moodd">The approach centers around futuristic and organic elements which<br> provoke a
				feeling of frigid cleanliness. Drawing inspiration from<br> organic design approaches and forms,
				sterile nature, liminal spaces<br> and the constant fight of technology vs nature.
				<br>
				<br>
				Architectural and spatial elements which have an overall clean and <br>cold tone, composed of white and
				blue colour palettes.Ultimately, <br>spaces which are devoid of human interaction or natural elements.
				</p>

				<p id="visual">the visual language</p>
				<p id="visuald">Throughout the experimentation process, we learned multiple<br> techniques that stablished our visual
					language and drove the<br> project. Printing and scanning and colour and type ﻿experimentation<br> drove our process.</p>

				The visual language from the poster was borrowed for the microsite<br> that is attached to
				the broken nature exhibition. The microsite<br> mainly focuses on ticket sales, however
				still contains information<br> about the exhibition, and includes video content from the artists.<br>
				Inspired by the main motion of a scanner, the site’s main interaction is<br> limited to moving in
				the y-direction, as if the user is scanning for the<br> information it needs.
