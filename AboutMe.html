			<p id="description">I am a third year design student at the School of Interactive Arts and Technology,
				interested in visual design and art direction. My personal passion for graphics, art,<br>
				and skateboarding have fueled my need to be in design. No matter the medium,
				<br>with insightful research, I seek to create innovative graphical assets that convey<br>
				emotion to the viewers. Coming from Spain, I've learned the importance of hard
				<br>work and making connections.</p>
