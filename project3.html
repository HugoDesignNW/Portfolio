	<p id="briefd">For a 13 week class project, my team was tasked with finding a client and exploring a design intervention. We were lucky to be able to work with North Vancouver’s <br>
<span style="font-family:bdLofi">The  Polygon  Gallery.</span></p>

		<p id="client">the client</p>
		<p id="clientd">Known worldwide for it’s award winning architecture and its relentless strive to create pathways for new voices within lens based media art, The Polygon Gallery is
dedicated to  creating a welcoming, barrier-free space for everyone, allowing art to be accessible to anyone interested.</p>

			<p id="primaryd">
				Based on ethnography done throughout the totality of the project, we identified troublesome touchpoints early in the Polygon’s Gallery experience. The gallery’s architects<br>
had the form of the building in mind, assuming people would be able to locate themselves through a generally small venue space without problems. While the<br>
architectural beauty is undeniable, the functionality leaves more to be desired from.	</p>

			<p id="ethics"> The main issue entails the entrance of the gallery. From our own personal experience and external ethnography, we realize the layout of the gallery is unlike any other<br>
“common” gallery. The general idea of a step based layout can not be found at The Polygon, leading patrons of the gallery completely ignoring the front desk at which<br>
the ticket buying process is available. Visitors are mostly <span id="boldbig" style="font-family:Neue Hass Grotes"> unaware of the ethics and etiquette</span> of the gallery, making the workers have to chase down the<br>
wondering visitors unaware of these rules. </p>

			<p id="workshop">At this point, we had a design workshop designed to reveal what space of the gallery is most important to them. We participated alongside Asia Harvey, the Gallery’s<br>
Sales Manager, and Rhonda Schultz, the Gallery’s Guest Services & Volunteer Supervisor. We participated in 3 exercises; </p>
