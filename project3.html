	<p id="briefd">My team was tasked with finding a client and exploring a design <br>
		intervention. We were lucky to be able to work with North <br>Vancouver’s <span id="boldbig" style="font-family:Replica Bold">The  Polygon  Gallery.</span></p>

		<p id="client">the client</p>
		<p id="clientd">Known worldwide for it’s award winning architecture and its <br>relentless strive to create pathways for new voices within lens <br>based media art,
			The Polygon Gallery is dedicated to  creating a <br>welcoming, barrier-free space for everyone, allowing art to be <br>accessible to anyone interested.</p>

			<p id="primary">identifying  the problem  <span style="color:#b2b0b0">ethnography</span></p>
			<p id="primaryd">
				Based on ethnography done throughout the totality of the project, we <br>identified troublesome touchpoints
				early in the Polygon’s Gallery <br>experience. The gallery’s architects had the form of the building in mind,<br>
				assuming people would be able to locate themselves through <br>a generally small venue space without problems.
				While the architectural <br>beauty is undeniable, the functionality leaves more to be desired from.	</p>

			<img id="signs" src="etiquette.svg">

			<p id="ethics"> The main issue entails the entrance of the gallery. From our own <br>personal experience and external
				ethnography, we realize the layout <br>of the gallery is unlike any other “common” gallery. The general idea <br>of
				a step based layout can not be found at The Polygon, leading <br>patrons of the gallery completely ignoring the front
				desk at which <br>the ticket buying process is available. Visitors are mostly<br>
				<span id="boldbig" style="font-family:Replica Bold"> unaware of the ethics and etiquette</span>
				of the gallery, <br>making the workers have to chase down the wondering visitors <br>unaware of these rules. </p>



			<img id="map" src="map.svg">



			<p id="lack"> Due to a lack of direction towards the front desk (which seems <br>only dedicated to the shop) and the bleeding
				of spaces with <br>no defined separation, the visitors end up wondering in areas <br>reserved for those that previously
				checked in. The workers then <br>need to interrupt the discovering process of the patrons, leading <br>to an uncomfortable
				confrontation between  the two.</p>

			<img id="chase" src="chaseimg.svg">

			<p id="workshop">At this point, we had a design workshop designed to reveal what space <br>
				of the gallery is most important to them. We participated alongside Asia <br>Harvey, the Gallery’s
        Sales Manager, and Rhonda Schultz, the Gallery’s <br>Guest Services and Volunteer Supervisor.
				<span id="boldbig" style="font-family:Replica Bold"> We participated in 3 exercises; </span></p>

			<p id="finalex">After 3 weeks of sprint exercises and iterative approaches we <br>found our final problem space:</p>

			<img id="frameimg" src="frameimg.svg">

			<p id="finalex2">Looking at The Polygon’s current physical assets, we noticed <br>they do not have a ticket or a ticketing
				system due to the fact <br>that they are on a by-donation basis. We found this to be a <br>great area to operate in for our
				final solution space. By locating <br>a ticketing system before the patrons come in to the gallery,<br> we can inform
				newcomers of the gallery’s etiquette, and <br>reiterate it to repeat customers. This can create expectations <br>to
				those coming repeatedly to the gallery on how to operate <br>and where to go within the gallery so that there is no
				need <br>to be interrupted by the understaffed gallery.
